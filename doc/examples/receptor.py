"""
Display a per face receptor density on a body surface modeled as
irregular dataset (vertices & triangular faces) - the receptor sheet

Display stimulation variables across the sensory receptor elements
modulated in time, controlled by a set of buttons

Pick a particular receptor and select/highlight downstream sensory
 neurons and interneurons influenced by this particular receptor.
 For multiple selected receptors, show overlap colorcoded

 - requires microcircuitry identifiers associated with receptor
   identifiers
 - requires graph representation of downstream circuitry with reachable
   nodes

Distinguish parallel pathways (towards central) based on receptor
or neuron type

Distinguish topological map in target structures in corresponendence
with the receptor sheet (orderly but usually deformed)
